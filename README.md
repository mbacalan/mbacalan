### Greetings, traveler!

I'm a front-end web developer, currently helping create all kinds of worldwide e-commerce sites.

Apart from front-end, I also have experience with building API's and basic server setups with Node.js.

I'm a big fan of open source, not only as in free code but as a whole philosophy and you can see almost all of my own projects here.

My current focus is [aureneBot](https://github.com/mbacalan/aureneBot), a utility bot for Guild Wars 2 on Discord.

That's all for now!
