### Greetings, traveler!

I'm mainly a front-end web developer but I also have experience with building API's and basic server setups with Node.js.

I'm a big fan of open source, not only as in free code but as a whole philosophy and you can see almost all of my own projects here.

My current focus is [aurene-bot](https://github.com/mbacalan/aurene-bot), a utility bot for Guild Wars 2 on Discord.

Thanks for checking my profile!
